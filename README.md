## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. Here is a detailed description of how a hypothetical **crypto-legal-documents** system would integrate with major cryptocurrency exchanges for automated trading and portfolio management.

### Executive Summary

A **crypto-legal-documents** system is not a trading bot itself. Instead, it acts as the **legal and operational backbone** that authorizes, governs, and monitors automated trading strategies executed by specialized software (trading bots/algos) on exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken.

Its core function is to translate legal mandates (from an individual, a fund, or a DAO) into enforceable, machine-readable rules and to provide a secure, compliant framework for connecting trading algorithms to exchange accounts.

2.  **The Execution Layer (Trading Bot/Algorithm)**
